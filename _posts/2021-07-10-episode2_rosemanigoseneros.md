Emanigos ( conjucated as Emanigu, Emaniga, or Emanigos ) has a few different characteristics as a form of alternative American comics that were partially inspired by Manga and BDs, or Bande Dessine. Emanigos is split between Emanigos Eneros and Emanigos Behansos. The former is defined by considerably darker content than is standard in American comics, but with a specific effort to be less gaudy and goofy in terms of how such darkness is being conveyed on the page.

In general American comics, having come a long way sense the era of the comics code authority, had periods of overcompensation, partially do the influence of manga, that saw the rise of increasingly gory sequential art by route of horror media. After a couple of decades have went by after the collapse of the code, eventually things were balanced out between protecting young minds, and wanting to go completely whole hog with violent and exploitative content. This era can be thought of as Americaâ€™s second graphic novel period, influenced as well by Alternative Manga introduced by route of Manga.

These days graphic novels of the Emanigos tradition, are published in landscape digest format, rather than the more traditional floppy format of American comics, and the standard digest format. So are also published in larger volumes of 9 inch width and 12 inch height format, although these are generally reserved for the founding fathers of the medium, and most books tend to be smaller so they can more easily fit in bookshelves.

While there are definitely still horror comics, most horror in Emanigos follows the manga, manwha, and manhua traditions that focus on dread and tension rather than specifically gory details. Aspects of Japanese mythology, specifically their ghost stories, were handed down from immigrants to American from Japan, and this made its way into the culture of the larger America comics scene, where J-Horror morphed into any horror book that used elements of Japanese horror, regardless of whether it actually originated in Japan. A similar phenominon happened with other genres, where Emanigos developed into a seperate branch of sequential art distinct from Manga, Manwha, Manhua, and other forms.

Because French and American culture were largely similar, there was less of a pronounced change in the BD aspect, except for the fact that most books were published in Proto-Hafestra: a French and Japanese fusion language. The main difference is that Emanigos tends to be produced and distributed more like books you would find in Fantagraphics and Drawn And Quarterly.

This was how a seperate branch of graphic novels formed, that used the 4-frame manga format to tell a larger limited series narratives about death and love.
